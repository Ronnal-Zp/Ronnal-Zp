- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ronnal-Zp or better known as Ronald_Zp, so you can find me in the vast majority of video games or platforms.

- 🕹 My favorite video game will always be PUBG, but I play a lot on mobile since my PC does not support very heavy games.

- 🏐 I also practice ecuavolley(volleyball adaptation in Ecuador), although on a small court with my friends.

- 🎧 I really like the musical genre called "salsa", although I don't know how to dance it, I really like the instruments that are used (I don't know how to play them either xD).

- 📚 I graduated as a technology in software development, but I was not satisfied with the teachings acquired and I am currently learning web development as a self-taught.
